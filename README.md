# Predictive Modeling of Agricultural Input Loan Default (“Impaye”) for Smallholder Farmers

This project focuses on predicting agricultural input loan default (“Impaye”) for smallholder farmers in Benin. We applied machine learning methods including **logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting** to:  

## Key Objectives
- **Identify key factors** influencing loan repayment risk.  
- **Predict high-risk cases** to enable proactive interventions.  
- **Provide actionable recommendations** to microfinance institutions, policymakers, and development organizations.  

## Overview
The project uses real-world agricultural loan data to train and evaluate predictive models, aiming to improve decision-making and reduce financial risk in the smallholder farming sector.
